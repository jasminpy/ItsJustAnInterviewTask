# It's Just An Interview Task
## Restaurant reviews analysis with machine learning
**What is NLP?**
Natural language processing (NLP for short) is a part of artificial intelligence for processing and analyzing human languages such as English. We use machine learning algorithms to process and analyze texts and even handle predictive analysis.

**Why Python?**
There are a variety of choices for using natural language processing on any text, but **Python** is known as one of the most powerful machine learning tools due to its diverse and helpful libraries.

**List of python libraries used in this project:**

-[Numpy](https://numpy.org/)

-[Matloptlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

-[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

-[Scikitlearn](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/learning-model-building-scikit-learn-python-machine-learning-library/).


- **Step 1: Importing the libraries**

First of all, import libraries written above. You can abbreviate the names of libraries for convenience.

- **Step 2: Importing the dataset**

Import the dataset and make sure the file is in CSV format.

- **Step 3: Cleaning the text**

To process and analyze the text, it is necessary to remove words without semantic load and prepositions. For this purpose, you can use Natural language toolkit (NLTK).

- **Step 4: Creating the Bag of Words mode**

- **Step 5: Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set**

- **Step 6: Training the Naive Bayes model on the Training set**

- **Step 7: Predicting the Test set results**

- **Step 8: Making the Confusion Matrix**
